- 👋 Hi, I’m Annette from Nairobi, Kenya. But, I'm currently living in Nagasaki, Japan, as I finish up my Master's degree.
- 👀 I’m interested in computer vision, generative image synthesis, and medical image analysis.
- 🌱 I’m learning how generative classifiers can prevent shortcut learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects aimed at solving generative modeling research questions.
- 📫 Please send me an email at annette.irungu@jkuat.ac.ke or message me on LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/annette-irungu) if you're interested in talking more :)
